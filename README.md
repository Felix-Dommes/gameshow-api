# My prototype project for my Gameshow using Rust + Actix-Web as backend and Vue.js as frontend

It is archived! See "gameshow-v2" for the new project.

Absolutely no authentication/security, free access to API and admin/game host interface, so makes only sense to play with friends!

Static game show (frontend) files are in folder Gameshow, which are also served by the Rust Actix Web server.
